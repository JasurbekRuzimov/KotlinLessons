It takes user input for N, calls findExtremal() and prints the result.\\n\\n- findExtremal(int N): A recursive function that finds the extremal order number. Base cases are:\\n  - If N is 1, return 1\\n  - If N is even, call findExtremal(N/2) \\n  - If N is odd, call findExtremal(N-1) and return the result + 1\\n\\nSo it recursively divides N by 2 if even or calls itself on N-1 if odd, until it reaches 1. This calculates the extremal order number in a recursive manner.\\n\\nThe key logic is in the findExtremal recursive function, which uses recursion and conditional branching on the parity of N to iteratively calculate the extremal order number.\&quot;,\&quot;/README.md\&quot;:\&quot;The README.md file is used to provide information about a project. Some key things it typically includes:\\n\\n- Project Title/Name - The name of the project, which in this case is KotlinLessons.\\n\\n- Description - A brief description of what the project is about. For this project it would likely describe that it contains lessons/tutorials for learning Kotlin. \\n\\n- Table of Contents - A list of the main sections/topics covered in the project to help users navigate.\\n\\n- Installation Instructions - If applicable, steps required to install/set up the project locally. \\n\\n- Usage - Instructions for how to use or run the project. For lessons this may outline how to go through the material.\\n\\n- Contributing - Guidelines for how others can contribute/participate in the project\\u0027s development. \\n\\n- License - The open source license used for the project (e.g. MIT).\\n\\n- Contact - Details for contacting the author/maintainer of the project.\\n\\n- Acknowledgements - Credits/thanks to any contributors or resources used.\\n\\nSo in summary, the README provides an overview and introduction and acts as a central source of information for users about the project - its purpose, contents, and how to get started with it. It helps new visitors and contributors understand and engage with the project.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
